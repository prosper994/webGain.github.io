   <strong>Make Your Map!</strong><br><br>
  Before you get to work, you should map out all of your plans and goals. Take notes and work on your daily schedule. It helps to include plenty of details.<br><br>

<strong>Test Your Marketing</strong><br><br>
Work on maximizing your offer and seeing how your audience reacts. Develop email lists, messaging, social media pages, and more. Keep track of what seems to work and what does not. <br><br>

<strong>Acquire New Leads</strong><br><br>
Start your lead generation with your website. From there, create content, run contests, engage with your audience, and branch out online. New leads can help you grow immensely!<br><br>

<strong>Work on Your Sales Script</strong><br><br>

Never make calls without having a sales script prepared. Being prepared can greatly increase your confidence, helping you to make more conversions. Be sure to prep your written sales as well.<br><br>

<strong>Stop Working on Nonessential Tasks</strong><br><br>
Prioritize working on tasks that improve your networking and business. You can outsource less essential tasks or hire a virtual assistant to help you stay focused on your tasks<br><br>

<strong>Don’t be Afraid to Delegate Work!</strong><br><br>
Delegate any tasks to others that are not part of your job or that are too distracting. Freelancers and other professional contractors can assist you.
<br><br>

<strong>Use Technology!</strong><br><br>
Another way to get rid of nonessential tasks would be to automate more of your work. Create automated ads on social media, use bots, and use financial apps. Technology can take a lot off of your mind- allowing you to work on other things.<br><br>

<strong>Engage With Your Audience</strong><br><br>
Make sure that you are always engaging with your audience online.The more you interact with them, the more conversions or clients you will make.
<br><br>

<strong>Review and Redo</strong><br><br>
Always take the time to review your work. Never be afraid to redo your work and make it better.<br><br>

<strong>Monthly Check-ins</strong><br><br>
Make a habit of reviewing your business at the end of each month. This allows you to reflect and change your goals as needed, so you can be more reactive.<br><br>

<strong>Create Online Profiles</strong><br><br>
Make profiles on freelancer hiring sites, as well as on social media. Update and post often to increase your engagement.<br><br>

<strong>Provide a Unique Product</strong><br><br>
Your business should offer something in-demand and different.This will encourage more people to shop with you.<br><br>

<strong>Use Ads</strong><br><br>
Advertising through social media works great at bringing new traffic to your website. Make sure you have relevant content and services for them!
<br><br>

<strong>Never Sell Out!</strong><br><br>
It can be tempting to sell your business. But, in most cases people want to buy it because they know it will be successful. Instead, keep pushing<br><br>

<strong>Focus on Your Brand</strong><br><br>
Find ways that you can save time in your life, so that you can focus on your brand. Many solopreneurs use services like Instacart, so they don’t have to shop.<br><br>

 <strong>Learn From Others</strong><br><br>
 Experienced solopreneurs have a lot to offer you! Be sure to listen to their knowledge. You can talk in person or read blogs<br><br>
 
<strong>Use a Sales Funnel</strong><br><br>
 You only need one, simple funnel to make conversions. Focus on one at a time and perfect it.<br><br>
 
 <strong>Get Regulars</strong><br><br>

 Focus your attention on returning customers- make sure they keep coming back.<br><br>
 
<strong>Keep Things Simple</strong><br><br>
It can be too easy to complicate your schedule and marketing. The simpler, the more conversions you will have. Plus, it is easier to track and research.<br><br>

<strong>Buy Some Leads</strong><br><br>
  Buying leads can get you moving in the right direction. You do not always have to wait for something to happen- you can make it happen yourself. Facebooks ads are a great place to start.</p>
